# UNP-Power_Bi-with-Power_Bi_HR-Data

Completed this project as a part of my Power Bi internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP)
Description : HR data in Power BI refers to the process of analyzing and visualizing human resources-related information. This includes data such as employee demographics, performance metrics, turnover rates, and more. By importing, cleaning, and modeling HR data within Power BI, organizations can create interactive dashboards and reports that provide valuable insights into workforce trends, productivity, and organizational health. These insights can inform strategic decision-making, optimize HR processes, and support talent management initiatives within the organization.
